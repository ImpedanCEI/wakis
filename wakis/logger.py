class Logger:
    """Simple structured logger for grid, solver and wakeSolver metadata.

    The Logger stores small metadata dictionaries for different components
    of a simulation (``grid``, ``solver``, ``wakeSolver``) and can persist
    them into a human-readable log file inside a results folder.

    Attributes
    ----------
    grid : dict
        Arbitrary metadata about the generated grid (sizes, bounds, files).
    solver : dict
        Metadata produced by the numerical solver (tolerances, timings).
    wakeSolver : dict
        Metadata produced by the wake solver and global simulation settings.
